Title: Burger Generator

Description: Burger Generator uses a markov chain concept to output and display various possible combinations of hamburger toppings. The idea behind it was to try and teach the program what are more common and less common orders to place these toppings, and then have the program generate possible orders based on a probability matrix it was given.

Setting up and executing program: This program has a simple setup. To run the program, make sure your system's version of python is up to date (mine runs Python 3.8.5) and then simply input a desired number of toppings as an arugment on line 138 before calling the program via a terminal command. Exp: python3 burger_builder.py
